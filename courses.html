                    <p>
                      An undergraduate course, otherwise referred to as a bachelor’s degree tends to be between three and four years long. However, there are some technical course that can take longer. For example, an architecture courses can run for five years. And to earn an undergraduate degree in the UK, you would need to complete 360 academic credits from a university or a higher education institute.
                    </p>

                        <h5>Academic credit</h5>
                        <p>Academic credit is the value assigned to a course or some other form of learning that counts toward program or credential completion (McQuarrie, 2016). Academic credit is used as a tool to compare learning achieved in different contexts. Credit is awarded to you when you have shown, through assessment, that you have successfully completed a module or a program by meeting the specific set of learning outcomes for that module or program (QAA, 2009).</p>
                        <p>Within the UK, one credit represents 10 notional hours of learning. Institutions use this guide as a basis for setting the credit value of a module or program before it is offered to students. For example, a module that is estimated to involve 150 notional hours of learning will be assigned 15 credits and one that involves 400 notional hours of learning will be assigned 40 credits. In the UK, a bachelor’s degree with honors is awarded to students who achieve 360 credits (QAA, 2009).</p>

                        <P>There is no specific answer to identify the exact cost of completing an undergraduate course. The cost of completing an undergraduate course depends on what course and university you would choose to attend to. But generally speaking, most universities charge higher fees for international students in comparison to home students.</P>
                        <p>For international students, an estimated cost for academic year 2021 on an undergraduate program can be between £14,000 to £16,00 per year excluding the cost of accommodation. The estimated accommodation cost can be between £800 to £1000 per month. But this cost of tuition and accommodation varies based on course, university, city, and area. To learn more about the costs, book an appointment to speak to one of our expert consultants.</p>

                        <p>Conversion courses are usually one-year taught courses and are often heavily vocational. There are different levels of conversion courses: certificate, diploma, and masters.</p>

                    <h3>Research degrees</h3>
                    <p>
                      Large part of postgraduate study deals with independent research. Research degrees are often referred as doctorates. The main type of doctorate degrees are PhDs, DPhils, integrated PhDs, and professional doctorates
                    </p>
                    <ul>

                        <h5>Doctorate programs</h5>
                        <p>Doctorate programs can be taken after completing a master’s degree. In some case doctorate degree can be taken right after the bachelor’s degree during which a master is earned along the way. A doctorate degree in the UK usually takes three to five years</p>
                        <p>The most important component of a PhD degree is the doctoral thesis. The thesis is research project on a special topic and can be between 40,000 and 12,000 words. The doctorate thesis needs to be worthy of publication and add something new to the field of study for a student to earn a PhD degree.</p>

For MPhil degree it is expected to complete a dissertation of between 30,000 to 35,000 words.
