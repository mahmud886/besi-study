                                                        Process of the admission interview/test.
                                                        <p>Some universities conduct physical interviews while inviting students to visit the campus. Others carry out interview with just telephone calls. For international students, it can be a video call or a direct phone call from the university admission team at a prearranged time and date for the interview.</p>
                                                        <p>For the admission test, universities follow a variety of processes. Some universities use external organisations to conduct the test.

                                        <h3>Step-5. Offer of admission</h3>
                                        <p>After the admission interview, some universities (if everything is okay) can make an offer/reject the application within a week. However, most of the universities take at least two to four weeks of standard period to make a decision. So be mindful that the admission process can run longer.</p>
                                        <p>At this stage, the designated admission consultant would process your application with a number of universities for several similar courses. It is because, depending on your academic merit and availability of place on the course, a university would decide your application on the course that you would apply to as your first choice. If you are accepted for your fist choice, the consultant would invite you to complete Step 6 (acceptance of offer) and continue with other steps.</p>
                                        <p>However, you may not be accepted on your first preferred course by the particular university. If this happens, the consultant will try to talk to the university and endeavour to get you onto the university as it is your first choice. If the consultant’s effort becomes unsuccessful, you would be given other choices for admission with a slight change of plan for the course as mentioned above. Once you have made some compromise based on the situation explained above and accept the second or third offer for admission on a particular course, the admission consultant would guide you to the next step to accept the offer.</p>
                                        <p>If you have been accepted by the university, you would be made an offer of admission. This is call admission offer. It comes in two categories such as a conditional offer of admission and an unconditional offer of admission for a particular course.</p>

                                                Conditional offer of a place
                                                <p>A conditional offer in made to students who need to fulfil some additional requirements before accelerating it to an unconditional offer. These conditions may vary between students. However, some of the common conditions of an offer can be that university might ask you to complete your English language test (if you have not done so during the application process) or the university might ask you to sit for an English test again to get the required grade on a particular component of your English test to make you eligible for admission at the course you have applied for. For example, in your IELTS test that you have submitted as evidence of your English proficiency, your overall score is 6. But on the writing component you only scored 4.5 which is too low to offer you a place on the course. In such case the university would make you a conditional offer asking you to sit for IELTS exam again and get the benchmark score (for example 5.5) on the writing component and accelerate the conditional offer to an unconditional on.</p>
                                                <p>If you fail to fulfil your attached condition on your offer letter, it is unlikely that you would get access to the course. Your designated admission consultant would guide your through to fulfill your condition if you are made a conditional offer.</p>

                                        <p>Once an offer of placement is made on a particular course, you must either accept or reject the offer. Sometimes, students get offers from more than one university and they cannot make up their mind regarding which course or university they should attend. Please make sure that you consult with your designated admission consultant or your family members and make the right choice in accepting or rejecting the offer in good time. In case you reject a certain university place, you must notify your rejection of offer to the course so that the university can offer that place to other students waiting to get into the course. If you do not do that, you might limit chances of other students to access to higher education on the session.</p>

Your designated consultant can help you to make the mandatory payments to the university. Some universities ask for this payment as immigration deposit whereas other universities ask to pay at least half or quarter of the 1st year’s tuition fees.</p>

There are different categories of scholarships available for students in the UK universities. Some are one time check whereas others are renewable and provide support to student in each semester. Scholarships are different from loans and they don not have to be payback.</p>
                <p>f a student is awarded a scholarship, he or she might receive the money directly to the bank account of the student. In other case, the scholarship money can be directly given to the university to pay or deduct the sum (scholarship amount) from student tuition fees.</p>
